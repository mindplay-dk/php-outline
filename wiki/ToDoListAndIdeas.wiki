= To-do =

Things I plan on adding or changing in the near future (e.g. before first release):

 * Apply any modifier to a block, e.g.: `{modify|replace:"apples":"cake"}I love apples!{/modify}`

 * Change the user-block syntax to use name=value syntax, similar to the syntax used for custom functions and inserts.
 
 * Implement clear_cache()

 * Support for caching in !OutlineTpl

Ideas for the future:

 * nothing right now...
